    <p><i>Tutor</i>. I understand you were at Newmarket yesterday.
    Is that so?</p>

    <p><i>Undergraduate</i>. It is. I was.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Tutor</i>. A shameless avowal. Are you aware that you
    have broken one of the disciplinary regulations of your
    College? I fear I must punish you severely. Have you anything
    to say why sentence should not be passed upon you. [<i>Assumes
    the black College Cap.</i></p>

    <p><i>Undergraduate</i>. Yes, Sir, I have.</p>

    <p><i>Tutor</i>. Then say it at once.</p>

    <p><i>Undergraduate</i>. I went to Newmarket to see&mdash;
    [<i>Hesitates.</i></p>

    <p><i>Tutor</i>. Proceed, Sir. Time presses. You went to see
    what?</p>

    <p><i>Undergraduate</i>. As a matter of fact, I was
    particularly anxious to see the Head of the University.</p>

    <p><i>Tutor</i>. What do you mean, Sir?</p>

    <p><i>Undergraduate</i>. The chief Dignitary of Cambridge, the
    Chancellor, the Duke of DEVONSHIRE.</p>

    <p><i>Tutor</i>. You are trifling with me.</p>

    <p><i>Undergraduate</i>. Not at all, Sir. The Chancellor was
    there in state. I saw him. My curiosity was satisfied, and I
    returned to Cambridge.</p>

    <p><i>Tutor</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). Ah, of course that
    alters the case. If you can assure me you did not go for the
    purpose of watching horse-races&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Undergraduate</i> (<i>breaking in</i>). Certainly, Sir. I
    do give you the assurance.</p>

    <p><i>Tutor</i>. That being so, I dismiss you with a
    caution.</p>

    <p><i>Radical Reformer</i> (<i>meeting Rural Labourer tramping
    to London</i>). Yours is a typical case, my man. You are a
    victim of our insensate Land Laws, or exploded Feudalism. No
    doubt you are leaving the country because you could not find
    employment there?</p>

    <p><i>Rural Labourer</i>. 'Tisn't that so much. Old Gaffer
    always had summat for a man to do, I can tell ye.</p>

    <p><i>Radical Reformer</i>. Glad to hear it, though it's
    unusual. Then I suppose it is the intolerable dulness of the
    country that drives you away from it.</p>

    <p><i>Rural Labourer</i>. 'Tisn't that either. Things be a bit
    dull in winter-time, cert'nly. But there&mdash;we've a Public,
    also a Free Reading Room, and&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Radical Reformer</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). Glad to hear
    it, again, I'm sure, though that also is unusual. Your house,
    now&mdash;rather, I ought to call it, your hovel,
    perhaps&mdash;lets in the rain badly&mdash;reeks with
    damp&mdash;only one room, and that a pigstye, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Rural Labourer</i> (<i>offended</i>). Come now, don't you
    call my house a pigstye! Three good rooms, and not a bit o'
    damp or dirt about it.</p>

    <p><i>Radical Reformer</i>. Then the wages are low, and a
    tyrannical landlord refuses allotments, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Rural Labourer</i>. Allotments! I could have as many as I
    wanted for the asking. But there&mdash;I <i>didn't</i> want
    'em, y'see, and I <i>didn't</i> ask.</p>

    <p><i>Radical Reformer</i> (<i>gravelled</i>). Then would you
    explain to me what is the <i>real</i> reason of your
    determination to quit the country for Town?</p>

    <p><i>Rural Labourer</i> (<i>surprised</i>). Why, don't you
    know? <i>There was only one collection and one delivery of
    letters daily!</i> I couldn't stand <i>that</i>, of course. I
    expect I shall find more in Lunnon. Good-day!</p>

    <h2>ONLY FANCY!</h2>

    <p>Mr. CHAPLIN has, we hear, entered with native enthusiasm
    into his mission to the Agricultural Labourer. It was entirely
    his own idea. "The Liberals have their Rural Conferences," he
    said at a recent Cabinet Council, "and we should do something
    of the same kind; only we must go one better. Of course the
    delegates liked their trip to London (expenses paid, their free
    breakfast, their shake of Mr. GLADSTONE's hand, and the
    opportunity of gazing on the supple form of Mr. SCHNADHORST.)
    That's all very well for them. But think of the hundreds of
    thousands green with jealousy because they weren't selected for
    the trip? These are all ripe to vote for us at the General
    Election if only delicately handled. What you want is a man of
    commanding presence, unfailing tact, a knowledge of horses, and
    some gift of oratory. If no one else occurs to you, I'll go."
    No one else did occur to the mind of the Cabinet. So the
    Minister of Agriculture set forth on his missionary
    enterprise.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We have been gratified by the receipt of many tokens of
    interest and appreciation elicited by our paragraph last week,
    reporting the state of the household markets. One takes the
    form of a parcel of Russian tongues. "These," writes our
    esteemed Correspondent (we omit complimentary preface), "should
    before cooking be soaked for a week in cold water, and then
    boiled for a day." We are not disposed to spoil a ship for a
    ha'p'orth of tar, and shall improve upon these generous
    instructions. Having spent a week and a day in personally
    directing the preliminary process, we intend to grill the
    tongues for thirty-six hours, fry them for an afternoon, stew
    them for two days, hang them out of the window for five hours,
    and then bray them in a mortar. We fancy what is left will be
    worth eating.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>RYMOND has been reading, with much interest, HENED's account
    of how he got the Influenza, and what he did with it.
    Apparently the first thing to do is, to "send for a
    thermometer," (as others would send for a Doctor), and take it
    to bed with you.</p>

    <p>"Evidently," HENED writes last week in <i>his</i> journal,
    "when a person does not feel well, he should try his
    temperature, and, if it be abnormally high, he should go to
    bed, and stay there until it comes down."&mdash;"Of course,"
    RYMOND observes, with rare lapse into cynicism, "when the bed
    comes down, he is bound to go."</p>

    <h2>THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. XXIV.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Piazza of St. Mark at night. The roof
        and part of the façade gleam a greenish silver in the
        moonlight. The shadow of the Campanile falls, black and
        broad, across the huge square, which is crowded with people
        listening to the Military Band, and taking coffee, &amp;c.,
        outside the caffés</i>. Miss TROTTER <i>and</i> CULCHARD
        <i>are seated at one of the little tables in front of the
        Quadri.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I'd like ever so much to know why it is
    you're so anxious to see that Miss PRENDERGAST and me friendly
    again? After she's been treating you this long while like you
    were a toad&mdash;and not a popular kind of toad at that!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>wincing</i>). Of course I am only too
    painfully aware of&mdash;of a certain distance in her manner
    towards me, but I should not think of allowing myself to be
    influenced by any&mdash;er&mdash;merely personal considerations
    of that sort.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> That's real noble! And I presume, now, you
    cann't imagine any reason why she's been treading you so
    flat.</p>

    <div class="figright"

             alt="'A mean cuss? Me! Really&mdash;'" /></a>"A mean
             cuss? Me! Really&mdash;"
    </div>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with a shrug</i>). I really haven't
    troubled to speculate Who can tell how one may, quite
    unconsciously, give offence&mdash;even to those who
    are&mdash;er&mdash;comparative strangers?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Just so. (<i>A pause.</i>) Well, Mr.
    CULCHARD, if I wanted anything to confirm my opinion of you, I
    guess you've given it me!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>internally</i>). It's very unfortunate
    that she <i>will</i> insist on idealising me like this!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Maybe, now, you can form a pretty good idea
    already what that opinion is?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>in modest deprecation</i>). You give me
    some reason for inferring that it is far higher than I
    deserve.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I don't know that you've missed your
    guess altogether. Are you through your ice-cream yet?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Almost. (<i>He finishes his ice.</i>) It is
    really most refreshing!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Then, now you're refreshed, I'll tell you
    what I think about you. (CULCHARD <i>resigns himself to
    enthusiasm.</i>) My opinion of you, Mr. CULCHARD, is that,
    taking you by and large, you amount to what we Amurrcans
    describe as "a pretty mean cuss."</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>genuinely surprised</i>). A mean cuss? Me!
    Really, this unjustifiable language is <i>most</i>&mdash;!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I don't just know what your dictionary
    term would be for a man who goes and vows exclusive devotion to
    one young lady, while he's waiting for his answer from another,
    and keeps his head close shut to each about it. Or a man who
    backs out of his vows by trading off the sloppiest kind of
    flap-doodle about not wishing to blight the hopes of his
    dearest friend. Or a man who has been trying his hardest to get
    into the good graces again of the young lady he went back on
    first, so he can cut out that same dearest friend of his, and
    leave the girl he's haff engaged to right out in the cold. And
    puts it all off on the high-toned-est old sentiments, too. But
    I don't consider the expression, "a mean cuss," too picturesque
    for that particular kind of hero myself!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>breathing hard</i>). Your feelings have
    apparently undergone a sudden change&mdash;quite recently!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, no, the change dates back
    considerable&mdash;ever since we were at the Villa d'Este.
    Only, I like Mr. PODBURY pretty well, and I allowed he ought to
    have fair play, so I concluded I'd keep you around so you
    shouldn't get a chance of spoiling your perfectly splendid act
    of self-denial&mdash;and I guess I've <i>kept</i> you around
    pretty much all the time!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). In other words, you have
    behaved like a heartless coquette!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> You may put it at that if you like. Maybe it
    wouldn't have been just the square thing to do if you'd been a
    different sort of man&mdash;but you wanted to be taught that
    you couldn't have all the fun of flirtation on <i>your</i>
    side, and I wasn't afraid the emotional strain was going to
    shatter you up to any serious extent. Now it's left off amusing
    me, and I guess it's time to stop. I'm as perfectly aware as I
    can be that you've been searching around for some way of
    getting out of it this long while back&mdash;so there's no use
    of your denying you'll be real enchanted to get your liberty
    again!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I may return your charming candour by
    admitting that my&mdash;er&mdash;dismissal will be&mdash;well,
    not wholly without its consolations.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Then <i>that's</i> all right! And if you'll
    be obliging enough to hunt up my Poppa and send him along, I
    guess I can dispense with your further escort, and you can
    commence those consolations right away.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>alone</i>). The little vixen! Saw I was
    getting tired of it, and took care to strike first.
    Clever&mdash;but a trifle crude. But I'm free now.
    Unfortunately my freedom comes too late. PODBURY's
    <i>Titania</i> is much too enamoured of those ass's ears of
    his&mdash;How the brute will chuckle when he hears of this! But
    he won't hear of it from <i>me</i>. I'll go in and pack and be
    off to-morrow morning before he's up!</p>

    <p><i>Porter</i>. Eef you register it, and your vrient is zere,

    <p><i>The H.M.</i> Yes, but look <i>here</i>, don't you know?
    Oughtn't I to make a row&mdash;a fuss&mdash;about it, or
    something, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Porter</i> (<i>moving off with subdued contempt</i>). Oh,
    you can make a foss, yes, if you like&mdash;you ged

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>confused</i>). Er&mdash;yes&mdash;thought
    I might as well be getting back.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Then I&mdash;I suppose it's all

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Fortunately&mdash;yes.
    And&mdash;er&mdash;<i>your</i> engagement happily
    concluded?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Well, it's <i>concluded</i>, anyway. It's all
    <i>off</i>, you know. I&mdash;I wasn't artistic enough for
    her.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> She has refused you? My <i>dear</i> PODBURY,
    I'm really delighted to hear this&mdash;at least, that
    is&mdash;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, don't mind <i>me</i>. I'm getting over it.
    But I must congratulate you on better luck.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> On precisely similar luck. Miss TROTTER and
    I&mdash;er&mdash;arrived at the conclusion last night that we
    were not formed to make each other's happiness.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Did you, by Jove? Porter, I say, never mind
    about that luggage. Do you happen to know if Mr. and Miss
    TROTTER&mdash;the American gentleman and his daughter&mdash;are
    down yet?</p>

    <p><i>Porter</i>. TRODDERS? Led me see; yes, zey ged zeir
    preakfast early, and start two hours since for Murano and
    Torcello.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Torcello? Why that's where BOB and Miss
    PRENDERGAST talked of going to-day! CULCHARD, old fellow, I've
    changed my mind. Shan't leave to-day, after all. I shall just
    nip over and see what sort of place Torcello is.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Torcello&mdash;"the Mother of Venice!" it
    really seems a pity to go away without having seen it. Do you
    know, PODBURY, I think I'll join you!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>not over cordially</i>). Come along,
    then&mdash;only look sharp. Sure you don't mind? Miss TROTTER
    will be there, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Exactly; and so&mdash;I think you
    said&mdash;will the&mdash;er&mdash;PRENDERGASTS. (<i>To
    Porter</i>.) Just get us a gondola and two rowers, will you,
    for Torcello. And tell them to row as fast as they can!</p>

    <p><i>The Real Japan</i> is the title modestly given by Mr.
    HENRY NORMAN to his book published by FISHER UNWIN. This, my
    "CO." remarks, seems to imply that all the rest (including the
    lady BIRD's not unknown work) is, as the Gentleman in trouble,
    who wanted to secure the advocacy of <i>Mr. Jaggers</i>, said,
    "cagmagger." This tone of bumptiousness is occasionally
    apparent in passages of the book, and is perhaps sufficiently
    explained by the circumstance, mentioned in the preface, that a
    number of the papers originally appeared in the <i>Pall Mall
    Gazette</i>. Foible apart, HENRY the Norman has contributed an
    interesting chapter to the history of a singularly attractive
    people. There is nothing new in the heavier parts, which smell
    vilely of Blue Books, and might as well have been written in
    Northumberland Street as in Yokohama. HENRY is best in the
    glimpses he gives of the people living their daily

    <p>In <i>The Poet's Audience</i> and <i>Delilah</i>, CLARA
    SAVILE CLARKE (whether Miss or Mrs. the Baron is unaware, and
    must apologise for stating the name as it appears <i>tout
    court</i>) has written two interesting but tragic stories. The
    Baron does not like being left in doubt as to the fate of any
    hero or heroine in whom he may have been interested, and
    therefore calls for "part second" to the first story.
    <i>Delilah</i>, short and dramatic. The Baron shrinks from
    correcting a lady's grammar, but to say "<i>Mrs. Randal
    Morgan</i> lay down the law" is not the best Sunday English as
    she is spoke. From <i>Fin-de-Siècle Stories</i>, by Messrs
    LAWRENCE AND CADETT, the Baron selects "A Wife's Secret"
    (nothing to do with the old play of that name), "Mexico," and
    "Honour is Satisfied." Try these, and you'll have had a fine
    specimen of an interesting <i>passe-temps</i> collection

    <p>In an article on the Salvationist disturbances at
    Eastbourne, the <i>Times</i> said that after the scuffle, "the
    Army reformed its dishevelled battalions, and marched back to
    its 'citadel' without molestation." In another sense, the
    sooner a reformation of the entire Army is effected in the
    exercise of Christian charity, which means consideration for
    their neighbours' feelings, the better for themselves and for
    the non-combatants of every denomination.</p>

    "He's not a practical politician," said some one, "he's a
    doctrinaire." "Is he, indeed?" said our excellent old Lady,
    "then I daresay I met him when I was in Scotland." Observing
    their puzzled expression, she added, "Yet it's more than likely
    I didn't, as, when in the North, I was so uncommonly well that
    I never wanted a medical man." Subsequently it turned out that

    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>II.&mdash;THE SOCIAL DUFFER.</h3>

    <p>If my Confessions are to be harrowing, it is in this paper
    that they will chiefly provoke the tear of sentiment. Other
    Confessors have never admitted that they are Social Duffers,
    except Mr. MARK PATTISON only, the Rector of Lincoln College;
    and he seems to have Flattered himself that he was only a
    Duffer as a beginner. My great prototypes, J.J. ROUSSEAU, and
    MARIE BASHKIRTSEFF, never own to having been Social Duffers.
    But I cannot conceal the fact from my own introspective
    analysis. It is not only that I was always shy. Others have
    fled, and hidden themselves in the laurels, or the hedgerows,
    when they met a lady in the way&mdash;but they grew out of this
    cowardly practice. Often have I, in a frantic attempt to
    conceal myself behind a hedge, been betrayed by my fishing-rod,
    which stuck out over the top. The giggles of the young women
    who observed me were hard to bear, but I confess that they were
    not unnatural.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:70%;">
        <a href="images/45.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/45.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Shyness is a fine qualification in a Social Duffer, and it
    is greatly improved by shortness, and, as one may say,
    stupidity of sight. I never recognise anyone whom I know; on
    the other hand, I frequently recognise people whom I never saw
    before in my life, and salute them with a heartiness which they
    fail to appreciate. Once, at an evening party, where the
    Princess BERGSTOL was present, a lady, who had treated me with
    hospitable kindness, I three times mistook her; once for an
    eminent novelist, once for a distinguished philanthropist, and
    once for an admired female performer on the Banjo. I carried on
    conversations with her in each of these three imaginary
    characters,&mdash;and I ask you, is this the way to shine in
    Society? You may say, "Wear spectacles"&mdash;but they are
    unbecoming. As to an eye-glass, somehow it irritates people
    even more than mere blindness does. Besides, it is always
    dropping into one's soup.</p>

    <p>People are always accosting me, people who seem vaguely
    familiar, and then I have to make believe very much that I
    remember them, and to wait for casual hints. The more I feel
    confident that I know them, the more it turns out that I don't.
    It is an awful thing to stop a hansom in the street, thinking
    that its occupant is your oldest College friend, and to
    discover that he is a perfect stranger, and in a great hurry.
    Private Views are my particular abomination. At one such show,
    seven ladies, all very handsome and peculiarly attired,
    addressed me in the most friendly manner, calling me by my
    name. They cannot have taken me for either of my
    Doubles,&mdash;one is a Cabinet Minister, one is a
    dentist,&mdash;for they knew my name, The MACDUFFER of Duff.
    Yet I had not then, nor have I now, the faintest idea who any
    one of the seven was. My belief is that it was done for a bet.
    The worst of it is when, after about five minutes, I think I
    have a line as to who my companion really is, then, my
    intelligent features lighting up, I make some remark which
    ruins everything, congratulate a stockbroker on getting his
    step, or an unmarried lady on the success of her son in the
    Indian Civil Service examination.</p>

    <p>The thing goes so far that I have occasionally mistaken my
    wife's relations for old friends. Then, when I am hostile, it
    is just as bad. I never, indeed, horsewhipped the wrong man,
    but that is only because I never horsewhipped anybody at all,
    Heaven forefend! But <i>once</i> I did mean to cut a man, I
    forget why. So I cut the wrong man, a harmless acquaintance
    whose feelings I would not have hurt for the world. Of course I
    accidentally cut all the world. Some set it down to an
    irritable temper, and ask, "What can we have done to The
    MACDUFFER?" Others think I am proud. Proud! I ask, what has a
    Duffer to be proud of? Nobody, or very few, admit that I am
    just a Duffer; a stupid, short-sighted, absent-minded child of
    misfortune.</p>

    <p>All these things do not make my life so pleasant to me that
    I, the MACDUFFER, should greatly care to dine out. Ah, that
    <i>is</i> a trial. First, I never know my host and hostess by
    sight. Next, in a summer dusk, I never know anybody. Then, as
    to conversation, I have none. My mind is always prowling about
    on some antiquarian hobby-horse, reflecting deeply on the
    Gowrie Conspiracy, or the Raid of Ruthven, or the chances in
    favour of PERKIN WARBECK's having been a true man. Now I do
    object to talking shop, I am not a lawyer, nor yet am I an
    actor; I do not like people who talk about their cases, or
    their parts. It would he unbecoming to start a conversation on
    the authenticity of "HENRY GORING's <i>Letter</i>." Then I
    never go to the play, I do not even know which of the Royal
    Family is which: modern pictures are the abominations of
    desolation to me; in fact, I have no "conversation-openings." A
    young lady, compelled to sit beside me, has been known to hum
    tunes, and telegraph messages of her forlorn condition to her
    sister, at the opposite end of the table. I pitied her, but was
    helpless. My impression is that she was musical, poor soul!
    When I do talk, things become actively intolerable. I have no
    tact. To have tact, is much like being good at Halma, or whist,
    or tennis, or chess. You must be able to calculate the remote
    consequences of every move, and all the angles and side-walls
    from which the conversational hall may bound. It is needless to
    say that, at whist, I never know in the least what will happen
    in consequence of the card I play; and life is very much too
    short for the interminable calculations of chess. It is the
    same in conversation. I never know, or, if my sub-consciousness
    knows, I never remember, who anybody is. I speak to people
    about scandals with which they are connected. I frankly give my
    mind about Mr. DULL's poems to Mr. DULL's sister-in-law. I give
    free play to my humour about the Royal Academy in talk with the
    wife of an Academician of whom I never heard. I am like
    <i>Jeanie Deans</i>, at her interview with Queen CAROLINE,
    when, as the MACALLUM MORE said, she first brought down the
    Queen, and then Lady SUFFOLK, right and left, with remarks
    about unkind mothers, and the Stool of Penitence.</p>

    <p>Thus you may see me forlorn, with each of my neighbours
    turning towards me the shoulder of indignation. I do not blame
    them, but how can I help it? It is the Fairy's fault: the curse
    has come upon me. WILLIAM BUFFY, the Statesman, has a great
    clan of kinsfolk. Did I ever express my views about WILLIAM
    BUFFY, but one of Clan Buffy was there, to be annoyed? When I
    find out what has occurred, I become as red as any tomato, but
    that does nobody any good.</p>

    <p>Oh, I am a Pariah, I am unfit to live! In a savage country,
    to which my thoughts often wander, I would stumble over every
    taboo, and soon find myself in the oven. As it is, I stumble
    over everything, stools and lady's trains, and upset porcelain,
    and break all the odds and ends with which I fidget, and spill
    the salt, and then pour claret over it, and call on the right
    people at the wrong houses, and put letters in the wrong
    envelopes: one of the most terrible blunders of the Social
    Duffer. Naturally, in place of improving, MACDUFFER gets worse
    and worse: every failure which he discovers makes him more
    nervous: besides he knows that, of all his errors, he only
    finds out a small per-centage. Where can he take refuge? If
    <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> had been a social Duffer, he and
    <i>Friday</i> would not have been on speaking terms in a week.
    People think the poor Duffer malignant, boorish, haughty,
    unkind; he is only a Duffer, an irreclaimable, sad, pitiful
    creature, quite beyond the reach of philanthropy. On my grave
    write, not MISERRIMUS (though that would be true enough), but
    FUTILISSIMUS.</p>

    <p>The waiting was done by Candidates, and during the evening
    the band played a selection, containing such well-known pieces
    as "<i>Souvenir de Mitchelstown</i>," the opening chorus of

    <h2>MR. BAYLY'S COAST-SPECTRE.</h2>

    <p>"It is scarcely credible that, at this moment, the elaborate
    telegraphic system of this country has little or no connection
    with our Lighthouses and Coastguard Stations." So said, quite
    recently, the <i>Illustrated London News</i> in an excellent
    article, appropriately entitled, "A Flagrant Scandal." It
    <i>is</i> scarcely credible, and creditable not at all. "Shiver
    my timbers!" cries <i>Mr. Punch</i> (in a nautical rage), "if
    there <i>is</i> a purpose for which JOHN BULL should eagerly
    utilise his 'telegraphic system,' it is for the saving of his
    sailors' lives." Mr. ROBERT BAYLY, of Plymouth, wrote a letter
    to the <i>Times</i>, "giving some instances in which lamentable
    loss of life was solely due to the inability of the
    Lighthouse-keeper or Coastguard to communicate in time with the
    nearest life-boat station." Think of <i>that</i>, ye British
    Gentlemen, who sit at home at ease.</p>

    <p>Aren't you ashamed of yourselves at the very thought of it!
    Well may "T. LAWRENCE-HAMILTON, M.R.C.S., late Honorary
    President of the Fishermen's Federation," say, in an indignant
    letter to <i>Mr. Punch</i>:&mdash;"Perhaps ridicule may wake up
    some of our salary-sucking statesmen, and permanent, higher,
    over-paid Government officials, who are legally and morally
    responsible for the present state of chaotic confusion in which
    these national matters have been chronically messed and
    muddled." Perhaps so, my valiant M.R.C.S. And, if so, that
    "ridicule" shall not be wanting&mdash;on <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
    part, at least. Here goes, for once:&mdash;</p>

    <h4>ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS.</h4>

    <p>This Company has been formed for the purposes of
    establishing a thoroughly reliable newspaper in the interests
    of the Drama, and the shareholders belonging to the Theatrical
    Profession of the United Kingdom.</p>

    <p>1. To uphold every Shareholder's claim to Acting as an
    Art.</p>

    <p>2. To secure the best possible criticism by enabling every
    shareholder to write the notices of his own performances.</p>

    <p>3. To take cognisance of the literature that grows up around
    the Stage, especially criticism in other quarters.</p>

    <p>4. To notice the Drama all the world over, when space
    permits.</p>

    <p>5. To support the work of the Profession in general, and the
    Shareholders in particular.</p>

    <p>6. To afford a means of exercising hobbies.</p>

    <p>7. To contain Articles by any of the recognised critics
    ("distinguished writers of the day").</p>

    <p>8. To serve as a Directory, or <i>Vade Mecum</i>, or
    Press-notes container for the benefit of the Shareholders.</p>

    <p>Many leading theatrical lessees, managers, and actors, have
    expressed themselves strongly in favour of the necessity of
    establishing a paper, written by themselves, for themselves, to
    read. Without such an organ it is impossible that they can be
    adequately represented.</p>

    <p>The need of such a journal has long been felt by those whose
    theatrical notices have been the reverse of satisfactory.</p>

    <p>A large number of prominent players have promised to take
    shares, and advertise, not only in the advertisement columns,
    but in other parts of the proposed paper.</p>

    <p>The price of the paper will be hereafter settled by the
    Directors, who feel that this is a mere matter of detail. The
    charge for advertisements will be very moderate, to suit the
    requirements of the shareholders.</p>

    <p>Pictures and all sorts of clever things will be introduced
    when the capital is subscribed, but it's no use making promises
    until the bankers have got the money.</p>

    <p>If there is a rush for shares (as anticipated), those who
    come first will have the preference.</p>

    <p>It may be stated that lots of people have promised to become
    shareholders which is satisfactory. But it is necessary to add
    that no one will be permitted to become a contributor to the
    paper even of the most interesting nature (<i>i.e.</i>, Press
    notices, &amp;c.), until he has contributed to its capital.</p>

    <p>It is the intention of the Promoters that the majority of
    the shares that be allotted to persons in or connected with the
    profession, so that there shall be no nonsense from
    outsiders.</p>

    <p>No promotion money will be paid to anyone. The only
    preliminary expenses will be those connected with law and
    stationery.</p>

    <p>It is proposed to start the Journal at once, per contract.
    The Promoters are in communication with a gentleman who will
    make a first-rate Editor, and who will (they believe) be
    delighted to accept such an appointment if offered to him.
    Special arrangements will be made for the insertion of such
    advertisements as "Wigs on the Green" and "Curtain Razors."</p>

    <p>As the paper will be sent about largely, it should have a
    good circulation, and the Promoters give as a standing toast,
    "Success to the Advertisement Department!"</p>

    <p>Under such brilliant auspices, both the Company and the
    paper (as the legal advisers, Messrs. BOX &amp; COX would say)
    "should be satisfied."</p>

    <p>In the event of no money being received, the amount will be
    returned without deductions.</p>

    <h2>THE HONOUR OF THE BAR.</h2>

    <h4><i>To the Editor of Punch.</i></h4>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;As the <i>London Charivari</i> is recognised all
    the world over as the universally acknowledged organ of the
    legal profession in England, will you permit me to make an
    explanation nearly touching my professional reputation. A few
    days since, a Correspondent to one of your contemporaries
    complained that the leading Counsel of the epoch were in the
    habit of accepting fees they never intended to earn. He more
    than hinted that we Barristers were prone to receive cheques
    for briefs that we knew we would never attend to; that we were
    ready to be paid for being present in one Court, when we knew
    that we were sure to be engaged in another. And so and so
    on.</p>

    <p>Now there can be but one interpretation to such a statement.
    I am reluctantly compelled to believe that some learned friend
    or other, annoyed at my increasing practice, has levelled this
    blow at me, with a view to lessening my prosperity. Will you
    let me say then, once and for all, I have never received fees
    for briefs to which I have paid no attention; that my presence
    has never been required in one Court when I have been
    professionally engaged in another? My Clerk, PORTINGTON, who
    has been with me for many years, will tell anyone interested in
    the matter, that I am most careful not to accept papers
    promiscuously. In conclusion, anyone who knows me will refuse
    to believe that I have ever accepted more business than that to
    which I have been able to give proper attention. It is not my
    custom to crowd my mantelpiece with papers appealing to me in
    vain for my consideration. At this moment I have not a single
    matter demanding my care, except a bundle sent in to me three
    years ago by a madman.</p>

    <p>Believe me, yours most truly,</p>

    <p>TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.&mdash;<i>Mr. Punch</i> is glad to
    congratulate everybody on the improvement in the health of JOHN
    LAWRENCE TOOLE, comedian. It may be remembered that Mr. TOOLE,
    being at Mr. EDMUND ROUTLEDGE's house, and suddenly feeling
    unwell, was pressed by his kind host to stay there the night.
    He accepted and stopped about three weeks. Mr. J.L. TOOLE
    recommends the "ROUTLEDGE Treatment" to everybody. He is
    enthusiastic on the subject. So many persons have acted on his
    advice, and when calling on Mr. ROUTLEDGE, in quite a casual
    and friendly way, apparently, have been suddenly taken worse,
    that the benevolent publisher who feels deeply the necessity of
    showing these distressing visitors at once to the door, wishes
    it generally to be known that "Open House" is closed as a
    "Casual Ward," and that he is not at home to anybody; except
    <i>bonâ fide</i> visitors who will give their written word,
    under penalties, not to be taken ill during their brief
    interview with him.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>NOTICE.&mdash;Rejected Communications or Contributions,
    whether MS., Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any
    description, will in no case be returned, not even when

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
